Credits given to Simple Traffic System and RoadArchitect:

Simple Traffic System was used to easily simulate traffic systems to develop AITOS' reinforcement learning model.
Certain files in this library was heavily modified to suit the needs of developing AITOS' reinforcement learning model. 

RoadArchitect was used to create the 4-way intersection where the reinforcement learning model was trained.
